## Automating a Boring Process for Our Designers
##### Date: 05/04/19

One of the first things I had taken into consideration regarding our rhythm game was the process of mapping the 'beats' to a given audio file, a process I'll refer to as 'beatmapping'. We knew we would need some sort of visual interface or tool to assist, but struggled to think of ways to streamline the process outside of creating new software. Another of our programmers (Ashley) made a lot of progress on a custom Unreal Engine plug in, complete with a waveform section for visual assistance! Eventually, however, we settled on using Audacity.
